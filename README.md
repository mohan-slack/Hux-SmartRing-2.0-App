# HUX App — Foundation

The first bricks of the HUX Flutter app (Track 2). Everything here follows
the rules in the Confluence space **HUX 2.0 Planning** — read pages 1, 3,
5, 6 there before writing code.

## What exists so far

```
lib/core/ring/
  ring_models.dart        The data contract. What "ring data" means in HUX.
  ring_adapter.dart       The wall. The one interface the app talks to.
  mock_ring_adapter.dart  A fake TM21. Realistic data, realistic failures.
```

## The one rule that matters

The app talks to `RingAdapter`. Never to a vendor SDK. Never to a platform
channel directly. When eIoT finally hands over their SDK, we write
`EIoTRingAdapter implements RingAdapter` as a Flutter plugin (Kotlin +
Swift underneath) and swap it in. Nothing above the adapter changes.

If a screen works on the mock but breaks on the real ring, the adapter
implementation is wrong — not the screen.

## Why the mock behaves badly on purpose

The real ring will miss readings, drop connections, and take longer to
sync after long gaps. The mock does all of these (see `chaosMode`).
Building against a polite mock produces an app that falls apart on
real hardware. Build against the rude one.

## Quick start

```dart
final ring = MockRingAdapter(chaosMode: true, seed: 42);

ring.connectionState.listen((s) => print('state: $s'));

final info = await ring.connect();
print('Connected: ${info.name}, battery ${info.batteryPercent}%');

// Catch-up sync: last 24 hours
final result = await ring.syncSince(
  DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 24)),
);
print('${result.snapshots.length} snapshots, '
      '${result.sleepSessions.length} nights');

final night = result.sleepSessions.last;
print('Slept ${night.totalSleep.inMinutes} min, '
      'deep ${night.stageTotal(SleepStage.deep).inMinutes} min');
```

## What exists now

```
lib/core/ring/       Data models, adapter interface, mock TM21
lib/core/storage/    HealthStore interface + SQLite implementation
lib/core/sync/       SyncService: overlap, retry, watermark
test/                Contract tests for all of the above
```

Storage guarantees (enforced by schema + tests, not by discipline):
- Idempotent writes: timestamp is the PRIMARY KEY, duplicates cannot exist
- Watermark advances only AFTER a successful save: crashes cause
  re-fetch, never gaps
- Every sync re-fetches a 1h overlap window on purpose; the store
  makes it harmless
- deleteAllData() wipes everything: the DPDP "delete my data" hook

## What comes next (in order)

1. **Meaning/Action engine** — pure Dart, consumes models, emits the
   daily readout. The product. Owned by us, never by eIoT.
2. **Screens** — Today, Sleep, Trends, Settings.
3. **Health-store adapter** — real data from Apple Health / Health
   Connect (dev tool; see wiki page 6 for the SDNN/RMSSD warning).

## Deliberate constraints (do not "fix" these)

- Models carry processed metrics only. No raw PPG fields until eIoT
  grants raw access (wiki gate 1).
- Nullable readings are normal, not errors. Missing data is part of
  the contract.
- No accounts, no cloud, no ML in v1 (wiki page 6).
